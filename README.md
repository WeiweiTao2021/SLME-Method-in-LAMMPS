# SLME-Method-in-LAMMPS
This is the source code that I developed to implementing SLME method in LAMMPS.

SLME method is a self learning potential energy surface exploration method developed by our group. It is able to simulate
long time events for various materials such as Nanowires, proteins and amorphous solid.

This is the main focus of my Ph.D. thesis at BU. More details on this method can be found in my publications in:
